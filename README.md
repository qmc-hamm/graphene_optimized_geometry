create_best_estimate.py 

This code reads a POSCAR file and appends it to a header file "best_estimate.hdf5".


1. Change twist angle, theta. This is referred as group in the hdf5 file. 
2. Change the method. This is referred as subgroup in the hdf5 file. 
3. The code reads POSCAR type of data file. 


best_estimate_reader.py 

This code reads the date generated, uuid, lattice vectors, coordinates  of the geometry twisted bilayer graphene of specifically mentioned twist angle generated by a specific method. 

1. Change group_subgroup. For example: group_subgroup = 6/DFT [Here, twist anglle is 6 degree and Method is DFT]



Include the method and twist angle you incorporated:
1. Flat

Twist angles: 0.99, 1.05, 1.08, 1.16, 1.47, 2, 2.88, 3.89, 4.4, 5.1, 6, 7.3, 9.4, 21.78


2. DFT_PBE_TS

Twist angles:  4.4, 6, 7.3, 9.4


3. MD_REBO_KC

Twist angles: 0.99, 1.05, 1.08, 1.16, 1.47, 2, 2.88, 3.89, 4.4, 5.1, 6
