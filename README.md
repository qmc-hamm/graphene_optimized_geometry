Twisted Bilayer Graphene -- Geometry Library
======================================================================
  
This repository contains a compilation of relaxed geometries for twisted bilayer graphene for a variety of twist angles, as obtained using a selection of different methods: first-principles density functional theory, classical interatomic potentials, and linear continuum elasticity theory.  There is also a directory containing rigidly twisted bilayers, without relaxation. 

The purpose of this repository is to enable sharing of geometries and facilitate comparisons of geometries obtained using different methods. These geometries can, for example, be analyzed using tight-binding models, etc.
