From literature [Nano Lett. 2016, 16, 9, 5923â€“5927], we have seen that there is assymetric buckling in twisted bilayer graphene in the rectangular cell. So, we tried to check if this is also present in DFT simulations. 

But from our simulations which initialized from flat geometry, we did not find any assymetric buckle. So, we cut the rectangular cell to hexagonal cell.
recttohex.py converts the output from DFT to a POSCAR file of hexagonal cell.
