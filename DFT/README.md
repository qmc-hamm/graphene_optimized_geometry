Relaxed structure data by using DFT 
===================================

DFT relaxation simulations are conducted by using PBE+vdW method developed by Tkatchenko and Scheffler [PhysRev B 87, 064110 (2013)](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevB.87.064110). All simulations are carried out by using VASP 5.3.3 [Phys. Rev. B 47 , 558 (1993)](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.47.558) 

Data available for the following twist angles (degrees):
4.4, 6.0, 7.3, 9.4
