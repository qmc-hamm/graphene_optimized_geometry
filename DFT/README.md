DFT structure data 
====================

DFT relaxation simulations are conducted by using PBE+vdW method developed by Tkatchenko and Scheffler [PhysRev B 87, 064110 (2013)](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevB.87.064110).

Data available for the following twist angles (degrees):
4.4, 6.0, 7.3, 9.4
