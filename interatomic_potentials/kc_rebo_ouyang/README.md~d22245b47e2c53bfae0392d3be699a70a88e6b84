Relaxed structure data by using classical potentials 
======================================================

Relaxed atomic structures are found by molecular static calculations using REBO potential [Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter 14.4 (2002)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0953-8984/14/4/312) for intralayer interaction and Kolmogorov-Crespi (KC) potential fitted by Ouyang et al. [nanolett 8b, 02848 (2018)](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.nanolett.8b02848).

Data available for the following twist angles (degrees):
6.0, 5.1, 4.4, 3.89, 2.88, 2.0, 1.47, 1.41, 1.35, 1.29, 1.25, 1.2, 1.16, 1.08, 1.05, 0.99, 0.93, 0.84
