### Processing scripts 

Processing scripts that can generate and process displacement fields for a given twist angle.
The generation scripts take the moire lattice vectors (m,n) and number of reciprocal points (nx) to generate a displacement field that is stored in a dill file.
The processing scripts read the dill file to build atomic coordinates.
