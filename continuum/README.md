Non-linear continuum relaxations

Relaxed atomic structures are found by interpolate a displacement field to atomic coordinates.
The displacement field is calculated using a non-linear continuum relaxation model based on PhysRevB.93.085410.

The displacement fields found in raw can be calculated according to the functions defined in scripts.

A preliminary set of relaxed atomic coordinates can be found in best_estimate.hdf5
