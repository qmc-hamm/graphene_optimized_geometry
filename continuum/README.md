Relaxed structure data by continuum theory 
===========================================

Relaxed atomic structures are found by interpolate a displacement field to atomic coordinates. The displacement field is calculated using a non-linear continuum relaxation model based on [PhysRev B 93, 085410 (2016)](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.93.085410).

Data available for the following twist angles (degrees):
9.4, 2.65, 1.2, 1.05
